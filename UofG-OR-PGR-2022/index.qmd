# Key Concepts

![[UofG Open Research Video](https://youtu.be/gGxtgEiRxYo)](images/open-research.png){fig-alt="Sketch of a 'map' to open research. There is a rainbow over the Glasgow Uni Building. Each stripe is labelled: Open research has many benefits, Visibilty, Transparency & reproducibility, Collaboration, Efficient use of funds, Credit for ideas, Public confidence."}

## Replication

![From *A manifesto for reproducible science* [10.1038/s41562-016-0021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021)](images/lego-replication.png){fig-alt="An idealized version of the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method. Various potential threats to this model exist (indicated in red), including lack of replication, hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing), poor study design, low statistical power, analytical flexibility, P-hacking, publication bias and lack of data sharing."}

## Reproducibility

![via the [Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions.html)](images/reproducible-matrix.jpg){fig-alt="Reproducible: same data, same analysis; Replicable: different data, smae analysis; Robust: same data, different analysis; Generalisable: different data, different analysis"}



::: {.notes}

* Reproducible: A result is reproducible when the same analysis steps performed on the same dataset consistently produces the same answer.

*  Replicable: A result is replicable when the same analysis performed on different datasets produces qualitatively similar answers.

*  Robust: A result is robust when the same dataset is subjected to different analysis workflows to answer the same research question (for example one pipeline written in R and another written in Python) and a qualitatively similar or identical answer is produced. Robust results show that the work is not dependent on the specificities of the programming language chosen to perform the analysis.

*  Generalisable: Combining replicable and robust findings allow us to form generalisable results. Note that running an analysis on a different software implementation and with a different dataset does not provide generalised results. There will be many more steps to know how well the work applies to all the different aspects of the research question. Generalisation is an important step towards understanding that the result is not dependent on a particular dataset nor a particular version of the analysis pipeline.

Of 35 articles published in *Cognition* with usable data, [Hardwicke et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180448) found:

* only 11 could be reproduced independently 
* 11 were reproducible with the original authors' help
* 13 were not reproducible even by the original authors

An analysis by [Nuijten et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2) of over 250K p-values reported in 8 major psych journals from 1985 to 2013 found that:

* half the papers had at least one inconsistent p-value 
* 1/8 of papers had errors that could affect conclusions
* errors more likely to be erroneously significant than not

## Open Access

::: {.notes}

Open access is promoting the early and wide sharing of research.

For research articles this means making the full text freely available on the web. This facilitates discovery and sharing of your work.

We recommend that you consider open access options for journal articles and conference proceedings in advance of submission. The Research Excellence Framework (REF) and many funders have open access requirements and policies.

# Key Practices

## Preregistration

## Registered Reports
