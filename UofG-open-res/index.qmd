## Key concepts

### Collaboration

All research roles are appropriated valued and credited

### Accessibility

Stakeholders can access research outputs

### Transparency

Processes are documented for others to assess and learn from

## Reproducibility

## Computational Reproducibility {.smaller}

Of 35 articles published in *Cognition* with usable data, [Hardwicke et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180448) found:

* only 11 could be reproduced independently 
* 11 were reproducible with the original authors' help
* 13 were not reproducible even by the original authors
    
An analysis by [Nuijten et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2) of over 250K p-values reported in 8 major psych journals from 1985 to 2013 found that:

* half the papers had at least one inconsistent p-value 
* 1/8 of papers had errors that could affect conclusions
* errors more likely to be erroneously significant than not

## Preregistration

## Registered Reports

## Replication

![From A manifesto for reproducible science, [10.1038/s41562-016-0021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021)](images/lego-replication.png){fig-alt="An idealized version of the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method. Various potential threats to this model exist (indicated in red), including lack of replication, hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing), poor study design, low statistical power, analytical flexibility, P-hacking, publication bias and lack of data sharing."}
