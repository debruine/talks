## GRP Advisors {.smaller}

* **Acting as a local point of contact for staff and students, to raise the profile of good research practice training and policies.**
* **Providing advice to researchers (staff and students) about good research practice, research ethics or integrity.**
* Providing informed support for those who may be considering
whether to make an allegation of misconduct.
* Liaising with the College-level Good Research Practice Champion
to refer misconduct reports to Research Services Directorate
(RSD).

# What is Good Research Practice?

## Key Concepts

### Collaboration

All research roles are appropriated valued and credited

### Accessibility

Stakeholders can access research outputs

### Transparency

Processes are documented for others to assess and learn from


## Replication Crisis

![From A manifesto for reproducible science, [10.1038/s41562-016-0021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-016-0021)](images/lego-replication.png){fig-alt="An idealized version of the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method. Various potential threats to this model exist (indicated in red), including lack of replication, hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing), poor study design, low statistical power, analytical flexibility, P-hacking, publication bias and lack of data sharing."}

## Analytic Reproducibility {.smaller}
    
An analysis by [Nuijten et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2) of over 250K p-values reported in 8 major psych journals from 1985 to 2013 found that:

* half the papers had at least one inconsistent p-value 
* 1/8 of papers had errors that could affect conclusions
* errors more likely to be erroneously significant than not

Of 35 articles published in *Cognition* with usable data, [Hardwicke et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.180448) found:

* only 11 could be reproduced independently 
* 11 were reproducible with the original authors' help
* 13 were not reproducible even by the original authors

## Computational Reproducibility

Of 62 Registered Reports in psychology published from 2014--2018, 36 had data and analysis code, 31 could be run, and 21 reproduced all the main results ([Obels et al, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245920918872))

![](images/obels.png){alt-text="Flowchart of sample: starting from sampling frame of 188 paper, to 79 in psychology domian, to 62 in final data set, to 36 with data and code available, to 31 with runnable scripts, to 21 with reproducible results"}
